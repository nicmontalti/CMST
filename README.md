# Computational methods in science and technology
*Univeristy of Groningen*

The full documentation of the projects can be found in the notebooks. A short description of every notebook is given below.

## Project 1: Solving equations
*(Mathematica)* The electric field and potential of a ring is computed using Mathematica. The result is used to compute the field insied a molecular accelarator composed of successive rings hold at different potentials

## Project 2: Solving differential equations
### Assignment 1
*(Python)* The motion of golf balls is analysed taking into account air resistance and drift.
### Assignment 2
*(Python)*  The behaviour of a piezoelctric sensor is analysed finding its differential equation and solving it numerically.

## Project 3: Statistics
*(Python)* Multiple fitting techniques are discussed, developed and compared. The analysis is conducted both on simulated and real datasets. In particular fits were made using the method of moments, $\chi^2$ minimization and maximum likelihood

## Project 4: Machine learning
*(Python)* Multiple machine learning techniques are discussed, developed and compared. After preprocessing the data from a given dataset, Random Forest, KNN and Naureal Netork algorithm are developed with sklearn.
